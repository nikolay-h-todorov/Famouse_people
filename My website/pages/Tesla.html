            Nikola Tesla was born in 1856 in Smiljan, Croatia. As a child, he showed an aptitude for mathematics and a fascination with electricity. After studying engineering and physics in Europe, he immigrated to the United States in the 1880s and began working for Thomas Edison. However, Tesla eventually became disillusioned with Edison's approach to electricity and struck out on his own. Over the next several years, he made numerous groundbreaking contributions to the field, including the development of the alternating current motor and transformer, and the invention of the Tesla coil.

            As an inventor, contributions of Tesla are really high. With his inventions he changed the way people live on a global scale. And of course thoose inventions are:
            -Alternating current (AC) electrical system
            -Tesla coil
            -Tesla turbine
            -Tesla oscillator
            -Wireless transmission of electricity
            -X-rays (discovered independently of Roentgen)
            -Radio (discovered independently of Marconi)
            -Remote control
            -Induction motor
            -Bladeless turbine
            -Tesla valve
            -Teleforce (particle beam weapon)
            -Electro-magnetic field
            -Neon lighting
            -Rotating magnetic field
            -Tesla frequency
            -Electric car
            -Arc lamp
            -Electrical generator
            -Tesla transformer
            -Tesla magnifying transmitter
            -Tesla experimental station
            -Tesla experimental coil
            -Mechanical oscillator
            -Geothermal power
            -Tesla induction coil
            -Tesla compass
            -Tesla disc turbine
            -Tesla steam turbine
            -Tesla pump
            -Tesla wireless power transfer
            -Earthquake machine
            It is important to note that some of Tesla's inventions were never fully realized or were ahead of their time and did not become widely used until years later. However, his work has had a profound impact on the modern world and nonetheless, Tesla's contributions to science and technology have had a significant impact on the modern world and continue to inspire scientists and inventors today. continues to inspire scientists and engineers today.
